### Hi there, I'm QN Lewis 👋

I am an aspiring developer on a journey to master the fundamentals of software engineering. I've been coding for **2 years**, exploring different languages and building projects to understand how software works under the hood.

- 🎓 I’m currently focusing on **data structures**, **OOP**, and **writing clean code**.
- 💡 I enjoy taking apart logic puzzles and turning them into working applications.
- 👣 I am looking for a junior role or internship where I can contribute while learning from experienced mentors.

### 📚 My Practice Projects

Here are a few exercises I've built to practice my skills:

**Python**
* **[Mars Rover Simulator](https://github.com/qnlewis/mars-rover)** - A logic challenge where I used trigonometry to navigate a rover on a grid.
* **[Gilded Rose Refactoring](https://github.com/qnlewis/gilded-rose-refactoring)** - A famous coding test where I practiced cleaning up legacy code and writing safety tests.

**C# / .NET**
* **[Car Inventory System](https://github.com/qnlewis/car-inventory-system)** - My first project connecting a user interface (Windows Forms) to a real database.
* **[Console Snake Game](https://github.com/qnlewis/csharp-snake-console)** - A fun experiment to learn how game loops and threads work in the console.

**Java**
* **[Person Profile Manager](https://github.com/qnlewis/java-person-profile)** - A study in defensive programming and ensuring data integrity with OOP.
* **[Java Algorithms](https://github.com/qnlewis/java-algorithms-library)** - A collection of common computer science algorithms I built to understand the language syntax.
